Predicting house price based on features (End-to-End Machine Learning Project)

The technique of projecting or predicting future values for real estate properties, such as homes, flats, or commercial buildings, is known as real estate price prediction. In order to help buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals make educated judgments on real estate transactions, the purpose is to give accurate property rates.

Below is the process I followed for real estate price prediction to help individuals and businesses make informed decisions in the real estate market:

1. Gather relevant data from various sources, including real estate databases, government records, online listings, and other public or private sources.
2. Clean and prepare the collected data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. Create new features or transform existing ones to capture important information that can influence real estate prices.
4. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights into its distribution, correlations, and patterns.
5. Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms or predictive models for the task.
6. Train the selected model on the training data, optimizing its parameters to make accurate predictions.
7. For the task of Real Estate Price Prediction, we need historical data with various features that can influence property prices. I found an ideal dataset for this task.

After training the model, I had to use it, so I used dash to build an app which will let the user input the features and get a predicted price of the house.
